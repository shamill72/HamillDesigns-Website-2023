              I am a web developer. I have been working as a professional web
              developer for the past two years at a company here in Franklin, TN. I
              have spent the last year building eCommerce sites in Shopify Plus,
              as well as a custom web application for annual employee reviews.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prior to becoming a web developer, I spent thirty years in the music
              entertainment industry. The first twenty years, I was a touring
              professional. I held positions as an audio engineer/technician,
              stage manager, production manager, and tour manager over the years
              for various artists.

            This project was created using PHP, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, MySQL.
            The company requested a digital format to create and store employee
            reviews. With over 500 employees, nearly 100 store managers and
            regional managers, the need to keep employees visible to only their
            direct reports was a challenge. This required some complicated SQL
            queries and nested queries. It was successfully launched and used in
            2022. I am currently rebuilding a newer version using Laravel 9.0 framework. The page to the left is a screenshot of the home page.

            The page to the left is a screenshot of a sample review in process.
            There are three different types of reviews, based on the employee
            position. Each review evaluated different areas depending on the
            employee's responsibility.

            When F9 Brands acquired Thos Baker outdoor furniture, the products were first sold on the Gracious Home website. There was a need to create an eCommerce site for Thos Baker. I made this in Shopify Plus using the Galleria theme by MileHigh as a starting template. I did a lot of customization in the JSON and liquid files, utulizing the Shopify CLI environment. The layout and image choice was directed by the UI Designer.

            Cabinets To Go eCommerce site was developed several years ago in Shopify. Since coming onboard at Cabinets To Go, I have helped to develop new functionality and maintain current functionality of the site. I also developed forms on the site that push the data to the company's ERP, NetSuite. There are plans to re-build the site in the latest Shopify format in 2023-2024.

            Gracious Home was developed several years ago in BigCommerce. I have maintained and developed some new functionality. I am currently re-building the site in the Shopify Plus platform. We are building this version to automate between NetSuite and Oracle's OCM. The approach is to have all products sync and update from NetSuite to Shopify and to have all product images sync from Oracle OCM to NetSuite, which will then update to Shopify. This will eliminate the need for a web administrator to upload and update products directly in the site.
